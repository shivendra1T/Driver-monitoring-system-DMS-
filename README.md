This repository shows the python codes I have with the help of ChatGPT on DMS. 
DMS_Code 1 to 5 is using the webcam on the pc and DMS_code 6 is using an Veo3 generated video.
And in the code mediapipe is used for eye tracking and YOLO8 nano is used for cellphone recognition.
The code is only tracking the basic things like closed eyes while driving, talking on the cellphone driving and if the eyes are covered driving.
